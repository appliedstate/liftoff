# Dan — Buyer Operating File

Role: Efficient Buyer — High-ROAS specialist

Current Role (multi-hat)
- Individual Buyer (MediaGo + Facebook) — target: $1,000/day individual net margin
- Facebook Factory — Architect/QA/Throughput owner; enforce guardrails; unblock DRIs
- Strateg.is — Product requirements liaison (PRDs, acceptance criteria, stakeholder sync)
- Cadence — Facilitates weekly team meeting on Wednesdays

Objectives (current quarter):
- Individual margin: $1,000/day from MediaGo + Facebook (buyer contribution)
- Factory enablement: Maryna/Catherine independently launch 4–6 campaigns/month; Dan ≤30m/launch
- Launches: 2–3/week, ≥40% break-even in 72h
- Scaling velocity: +20–40%/day on ROAS rules
- Strateg.is: PRDs/requirements delivered on-time with clear DoD and integration notes

KPIs:
- margin_per_spend
- efficiency_ratio
- scale_ceiling
- media_go_net_margin
- prd_on_time_delivery

ROI Accountability:
- EmployerROI (monthly) = (PortfolioMargin − Bonus) / (Base_monthly × M)
- Targets: EmployerROI ≥ 2.0; no payout below 1.0

SOPs
- ROAS scaling rules; prioritize high-ROAS niches
- Jim policy: EWMA(hl=3d) with confirmation; guardrails (freeze <1.10 next day; revert if <1.00 twice)

Management Plan
- Daily: Apply Jim gates at 12:00/18:00 PST; log actions and outcomes
- Weekly (Wed): Run team meeting; review KPIs, bottlenecks, next actions; confirm owner/DoD
- Delegation: DRIs (Maryna/Catherine) own 80% of launch flow; Dan as reviewer/QA
- Strateg.is: Maintain PRD queue; each new initiative requires Impact Filter + acceptance criteria
