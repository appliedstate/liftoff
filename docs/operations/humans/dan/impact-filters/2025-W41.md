Title: Facebook Scale + Enablement
Owner: Dan
Week (YYYY-WW): 2025-W41
Timezone: PST

Purpose/Importance:
Enable sustainable Facebook scaling and reduce Dan as bottleneck by onboarding Maryna/Catherine to run launches.

Ideal Outcome (quant, dated):
+$200/day net margin average this week; 2–3 launches with DRI outside Dan by Friday.

Best Result:
+$300/day, 3 launches, zero learning resets.

Acceptable Result:
+$150/day, 2 launches, minimal resets with documented cause.

Success Metrics/KPIs (with targets):
- Daily net margin: ≥ $200/day
- Launches: 2–3; ≥40% break-even in 72h
- Scaling velocity: +20–40%/day on qualified campaigns

Consequences of Not Doing:
Stagnant margin, Dan as single point of failure, slow pace to $5k/day.

Risks/Assumptions:
Data latency, creative fatigue, insufficient conversions per ad set.

Resources/Constraints:
Jim-policy script, Aion advisor, existing creatives, buyer time.

First Moves (next 7 days):
- Apply Jim gates at 12:00 PST; scale si0519o06p5 +20%; pause underperformers.
- Consolidate fragmented ad sets; target ≥50 conv/week.
- Run 2 joint launches with Maryna/Catherine; Dan reviews.

Interfaces (AI agents / terminal / strateg.is needs):
- aion, jim
- terminal: checklist automation
- strateg.is: reconciled daily report
