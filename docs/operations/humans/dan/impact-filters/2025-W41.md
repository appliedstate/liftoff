Title: Individual Margin + Factory Enablement + Strateg.is PRDs
Owner: Dan
Week (YYYY-WW): 2025-W41
Timezone: PST

Purpose/Importance:
Hit +$1,000/day individual net margin across MediaGo + Facebook while enabling Factory throughput and keeping strateg.is PRDs on time.

Ideal Outcome (quant, dated):
+$200/day net margin average this week on path to +$1,000/day EOM; 2–3 launches with DRI outside Dan by Friday; 100% PRDs on time.

Best Result:
+$300/day, 3 launches, zero learning resets.

Acceptable Result:
+$150/day, 2 launches, minimal resets with documented cause.

Success Metrics/KPIs (with targets):
- Daily net margin (individual): ≥ $200/day (MediaGo + Facebook)
- Launches: 2–3; ≥40% break-even in 72h
- Scaling velocity: +20–40%/day on qualified campaigns
- PRD on-time delivery: 100%

Consequences of Not Doing:
Stagnant margin, Dan as single point of failure, slow pace to $5k/day.

Risks/Assumptions:
Data latency, creative fatigue, insufficient conversions per ad set.

Resources/Constraints:
Jim-policy script, Aion advisor, existing creatives, buyer time.

First Moves (next 7 days):
- Apply Jim gates at 12:00 PST; scale si0519o06p5 +20%; pause underperformers.
- Consolidate fragmented ad sets; target ≥50 conv/week.
- Run 2 joint launches with Maryna/Catherine; Dan reviews.
- MediaGo: daily net margin tracking + actions log; pursue top buckets; kill laggards.
- Strateg.is: confirm acceptance criteria and owners for active PRDs; unblock engineering.

Interfaces (AI agents / terminal / strateg.is needs):
- aion, jim
- terminal: checklist automation
- strateg.is: reconciled daily report; PRD tracker updated
