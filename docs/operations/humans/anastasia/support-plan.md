# Anastasia — Support Plan (from letter to Narbeh)

Purpose: Convert Anastasia’s concerns into concrete actions with owners, timelines, and success metrics. All times PST.

## Core Themes (from letter)
- Missing basic tools on non-FB platforms (publisher performance report; MediaGo budget API; cross-platform rules engine)
- Creative process underpowered (templates, knowledge-sharing, universal formats)
- FB work perceived as overcomplicated; other platforms lack minimum viable tooling
- Communication gaps (distance to decision-makers; slow feedback)

## Actions

1) Publisher Performance Report (cross-platform)
- Owner: Data/strateg.is
- Scope: Internal pub-level revenue/clicks/RPC with blocklists applied globally
- Timeline: PRD this week; MVP in 2 weeks
- Success: Ability to block underperforming pubs across campaigns; measurable RPC uplift

2) MediaGo Budget Change API + Caps
- Owner: Infra
- Scope: Budget up/down via API; per-pub daily cap guardrails (< $1,000)
- Timeline: PRD this week; MVP in 2–3 weeks
- Success: Intraday budget control; no single pub breaches cap

3) Terminal Rules Engine (Cross-Platform)
- Owner: Infra/Terminal
- Scope: Rule: if clicks ≥10 and RPC < X → −20% budget (with change logs)
- Timeline: MVP in 2 weeks
- Success: Automated small nudge actions; human review for escalations

4) Session-Level RPC (Device/Geo)
- Owner: Data/strateg.is
- Scope: Desktop RPC; mobile RPC by state; integrate into dashboards
- Timeline: Spec this week; phased rollout in 3–4 weeks
- Success: Faster learning; improved targeting and scaling decisions

5) Creative System Upgrade
- Owner: Creative Lead + Buyers
- Scope: Weekly knowledge-share; universal creative templates (persona/text formats); brief template; 3 assets/week reserved for Anastasia
- Timeline: Start this week
- Success: Faster CPA improvements; time-to-breakeven reduced

6) Communication & Recognition
- Owner: AI Manager
- Scope: Twice-daily ops feedback (<24h); weekly spotlight of optimization wins; assisted-margin tagging (ASSISTED_BY:Anastasia, 30-day window)
- Timeline: Start immediately
- Success: Clear recognition; measurable assisted margin

## Cadence & Interfaces
- Weekly Impact Filter required for new initiatives
- 12:00/18:00 PST logs with deltas and rationale
- strateg.is: portfolio & assisted margin, RPC dashboards
- Terminal: scaling, RPC-monitor tagging

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Tooling delays → Mitigation: Basic manual workflows, phased MVPs
- Risk: Creative bandwidth → Mitigation: Template-first, shared assets
- Risk: Data quality → Mitigation: Validate metrics vs S1, add QA checks

## Status Tracking
- Link PRDs: publisher-report, mediago-budget-api, terminal-rules
- Add to monthly tooling forum; include buyer questionnaire

## Message to Anastasia
We read your letter and agree on priorities. We’re shipping the missing basics (pub report, budget API, rules engine) and upgrading creative workflows. You’ll have 24h feedback on ops, formal assist credit, and dedicated creative slots. Let’s align your Impact Filter this week on two RPC categories and template needs; we’ll unblock fast and track outcomes transparently.
