# 60 — Launch Protocol (Batch Start, Freeze, Stabilize)

A deterministic, agent-executable SOP to take the Minimal Viable Scale Stack (MVSS) live without thrashing learning. Use **batch launch**, a **48–72h freeze window**, and **post-freeze validation** before any scaling.

---

## 1) Budget Plan (computed from `initial_daily_spend_total`)

At launch, allocate by lane. For **$6,000/day** example:

| Lane / Campaign                         | % of Total | Budget (USD) |
|---|---:|---:|
| **ASC — Broad**                         | 33%        | $2,000 |
| **ABO — LAL 1% (stability)**            | 17%        | $1,000 |
| **ABO — LAL 2–5% (reach)**              | 17%        | $1,000 |
| **ABO — Contextual (intent mirror)**    | 17%        | $1,000 |
| **Creative Sandbox (CBO/ABO)**          | 13–15%     | $750–900 |
| **Warm / Retargeting**                  | 3–7%       | $200–400 |

> **Formula:**  
> ```
> ASC = 0.33 * total
> LAL1 = 0.17 * total
> LAL2_5 = 0.17 * total
> CONTEXT = 0.17 * total
> SANDBOX = 0.13–0.15 * total
> WARM = remainder (0.03–0.07 * total)
> ```
Clamp to whole dollars; never exceed platform minimums.

---

## 2) Creative & Article Loading Rules (launch set)

- **Ads per ad set at launch:** **10–15** (12 recommended).  
- **ASC ads live:** **20–40** across ≥ **6 distinct hooks**.  
- **LPIDs per stability lane (LAL 1%):** **2–3** best pages only.  
- **Sandbox:** all *new* variants begin here.  
- **Naming:** `VERTICAL__LPID__HOOK__FORMAT__YYYYMMDD`.

---

## 3) T-Timeline (account timezone)

### T-72 to T-24 hours — **Preflight**
1. **Infra checks**
   - AEM: **Purchase (value)** at **rank #1**; domain **Verified**.
   - CAPI: send **test Purchase(value)**; confirm **EMQ ≥ 5**, p50 latency ≤ **300s**.
   - LPID & UTM instrumentation verified in GA4 (sessions resolve to LPID).
2. **Inventory**
   - LPIDs: **≥12–20** live pages (or ready to publish).  
   - Creative: **≥40–70** ads ready across articles.
3. **Terminal**
   - Set `dryRun=true`. Load rules but **no writes** during freeze window.
4. **Build staging**
   - Create campaigns & ad sets **in draft** with correct budgets, placements, attribution window.

### T-3 hours — **Final checklist**
- Diagnostics clear (no pixel/CAPI conflicts; dedup OK).  
- Learning-Limited flags from prior tests are closed (fresh entities for launch).  
- Frequency reset: no lingering high-freq retargeting creatives active by mistake.

### T-0 — **Batch launch**
- Publish **all MVSS campaigns** within a 15–30 minute window:
  - **ASC — Broad** (Sales → Optimize to **Purchase (Value)**, Advantage+ Placements, Broad).  
  - **ABO — LAL 1%** (seed: Purchasers 90d, exclude Purchasers 30d).  
  - **ABO — LAL 2–5%** (same seed, 2–5% LAL).  
  - **ABO — Contextual** (1–2 interest stacks mapped to RSOC queries).  
  - **Creative Sandbox** (CBO or ABO).  
  - **Warm/Retargeting** (tight 7–30d windows).
- Set **launch_status = live | frozen**.
- Start **freeze_window** timer (**48–72h**).

### T+1h to T+24h — **Observe only**
- **No edits** to budgets, bids, targeting, or ad counts.  
- Monitor (read-only): delivery start, EMQ distribution, event latency, fatal diagnostics, basic spend pacing.

### T+48–72h — **Stabilization review (end of freeze)**
- Compute **early economics** (directional): sessions, advertiser-click rate, avg click value, vRPS by LPID.  
- Delivery health: events/ad set/week pace (run-rate), Learning Limited flags, freq, EMQ p50.

---

## 4) Acceptance Checks (to exit freeze)

Mark **pass** only if all hold for the window:

- **Signal:** CAPI **Purchase(value)** flowing; **EMQ p50 ≥ 5**; p50 latency ≤ **300s**.  
- **Learning density:** run-rate **≥ 50** Purchase(value) events/ad set/week (or trending to it by Day 3).  
- **Fragmentation:** ≤ **15 ads/ad set** (no dumps post-launch).  
- **Economics sanity:** no LPID below **vRPS floor** by >10% for 3,000 sessions without a refresh ticket.  
- **Stability:** no critical diagnostics; frequency < **3** on prospecting.

If **any fail** → remain frozen; create **FIX tickets** (page refresh, creative rotation, signal repair). Re-evaluate after remediation.

---

## 5) First Edits (post-freeze, batch only)

Perform edits in **one batch** after passing acceptance:

- **Creative:**  
  - Promote **Sandbox top 10–20%** (by vRPS) → **ASC + LAL 1%**.  
  - Prune **bottom 50%** in Sandbox.
- **Article:**  
  - Open refresh tickets for bottom **20%** LPIDs (by vRPS).  
  - Publish **2–3 new** LPIDs if inventory permits.
- **Terminal:**  
  - Keep `dryRun=true` until the first **post-freeze readout** is green; then set `dryRun=false` (writes on) with **risk-down** actions enabled, **scaling disabled** for the first 24h.

> **Do not** change targeting, placement, or attribution here. Keep structure stable.

---

## 6) Handover to Scaling (not part of launch edit)

Once post-freeze + first-edit readout is green:

- Evaluate **Session ROAS (7d) ≥ 1.30×**, **events/ad set/week ≥ 50**, **CPA drift ≤ +5%** (3–5 days).  
- If gates hold → follow `/60-operations/62-budget-bump-protocol.md` (**+20–30%** bumps on **ASC**, ≤2/week).

---

## 7) Checklists (agent-executable)

### 7.1 Go/No-Go (pre-launch)
- [ ] AEM Purchase(value) rank **#1**; domain **Verified**  
- [ ] CAPI test Purchase(value) received; **EMQ ≥ 5**, latency p50 ≤ **300s**  
- [ ] LPIDs **≥12–20**; UTMs + LPID confirmed in GA4  
- [ ] Creative **≥40–70**; ads organized per lane rules  
- [ ] Terminal rules loaded; **dryRun=true**  
- [ ] Campaigns/ad sets drafted with correct budgets & settings

### 7.2 Freeze Window (48–72h)
- [ ] No structural edits (guard active)  
- [ ] Observe diagnostics, EMQ, latency, spend pacing  
- [ ] Record run-rate **events/ad set/week** and learning states

### 7.3 Exit Freeze (acceptance)
- [ ] EMQ p50 **≥ 5**, latency p50 **≤ 300s**  
- [ ] Events/ad set/week **≥ 50** (or on pace)  
- [ ] ≤ 15 ads/ad set  
- [ ] LPIDs meeting economics; refresh tickets opened as needed  
- [ ] Frequency < **3** on prospecting

---

## 8) Rollback & Failure Modes

- **Signal failure** (no CAPI/low EMQ): keep frozen; fix identifiers (hashed em/ph, IP/UA, fbc/fbp, external_id), verify event_id dedup; re-test.  
- **Learning stall** (events/ad set/week < 35): consolidate ads, reduce ad count to **10–12**, ensure budgets aren’t split across too many sets.  
- **Economics miss** (vRPS sag): refresh page (hero/intro/module order/speed) before further traffic.  
- **Delivery anomalies** (freq spikes, CPM shocks): hold budgets; rotate **3–5** new creatives once freeze ends.

---

## 9) Telemetry to Snapshot (store at T+4h, T+24h, T+72h)

- **Signal:** events_received, EMQ p50, p50 latency, dedup_rate  
- **Delivery:** Learning Limited flags, events/ad set/week run-rate, freq, CPM/CTR/CPC  
- **Economics:** sessions, advertiser-CTR, avg click value, **vRPS** by LPID  
- **Status:** launch_status, guard violations (if any)

---

## 10) Outputs & Handover

On success, write:
- `campaign_ids`, `ad_set_ids`, `ads_published_count`  
- `diagnostics_snapshot` and `launch_status = stabilized`  
- Handoff pointer to `/60-operations/61-promotion-prune-scale.md` (promotion cycle) and `/60-operations/62-budget-bump-protocol.md` (scaling)
