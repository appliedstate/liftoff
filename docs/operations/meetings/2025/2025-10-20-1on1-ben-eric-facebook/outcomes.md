# Executive Summary

Discussed current friction in Facebook execution and role clarity. Priority is contribution over management. Repeated setup errors (geo, domains, sloppy configs) are undermining confidence and speed. Two high-leverage growth paths: (1) expand proven categories internationally; (2) systematically discover new categories via Facebook Ad Library/API using persistence signals (active 7–10 days, multiple versions). Dan should focus on accurate deployments and category discovery, coordinating with Marina; evaluate Phil for Facebook International to offload Eric’s bandwidth on non-preferred work. Need a central pipeline for ideas → evaluation → deployment.

## Decisions

- Company bias is contribution over management; minimize “overseer” roles
- Use Ad Library/API with persistence signals for category scouting
- Internationalize winners in other English-speaking markets as near-term lever
- Evaluate Phil for Facebook International ownership

## Actions (Tasks)

- [ ] Draft FB category scouting SOP (signals, steps, tools) — Owner: Dan — Due: 2025-10-22 — Priority: H
- [ ] Stand up category backlog sheet (source, link, rationale, status) — Owner: Dan — Due: 2025-10-22 — Priority: H
- [ ] Fix campaign setup checklist (geo, domain, naming, QA) — Owner: Dan — Due: 2025-10-21 — Priority: H
- [ ] Trial 3 international deployments of proven categories — Owner: Marina — Due: 2025-10-24 — Priority: M
- [ ] Sync with Phil re: FB International scope/fit — Owner: Eric — Due: 2025-10-21 — Priority: M
- [ ] Add Ad Library/API access script or manual process — Owner: Dan — Due: 2025-10-24 — Priority: M

## Projects

- Facebook Category Discovery Pipeline — Outcome: Weekly list of 10+ vetted categories with supporting links and rationale — Owner: Dan
- International Expansion Playbook — Outcome: Repeatable process to roll winners into CA/UK/AU with <48h setup time — Owner: Marina (support: Phil)

## Principles

- Contribution over management; reduce coordination tax
- Quality first: accurate setup prevents downstream rework
- Systematize discovery; use observable signals to raise hit rate

## Product PRDs

- PRD: Facebook Category Scout — Link: docs/prd/strategis-facebook-metrics-endpoint.md (related) — Status: idea
- PRD: International Deployment Automations — Link: docs/operations/systems/facebook-factory.md — Status: idea

## Risks and Unknowns

- Risk: Ad Library scraping limits or redirects — Mitigation: Mix manual review, URL extraction, alternate sources
- Risk: Continued setup errors stall testing — Mitigation: Enforce checklist + final QA gate
- Risk: International creative/offer mismatch — Mitigation: Localized compliance check, quick revert path
