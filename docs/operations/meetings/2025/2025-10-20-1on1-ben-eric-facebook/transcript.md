Well, no, I mean, this feels fun. I feel like I'm getting interrogated. Well, yeah, garbage just ruined the vibe. No, the weather. I was here for... No, no, no. But I think I think if 2 people are responsible for the campaign, one person's going to end up actually looking at it and managing it. So like, how do we so what's the bat forward there? So the question for Dan is, does he want to be a Facebook immunity virus? No, that's kind of what I have.

Like, how does what does somebody like to do? I know there's a fine line between, what do you like to do and what do we need you to do? But is there something that he kind of likes to do that we could work into this? Because I don't think he likes me buying it all. And well, Michael was like, hey, you were hired in Spanish. Yeah. So if the objective is for you to manage, like, how does he remove the management layer? from you? in terms of like orchestrating Marina, or Catherine, or other media buyers, or this list. And so, you know, I know you're Fuelte. You want to get in there and just, like, be in your flow. Right? So it's like, how do I, like, how do I remove distractions when you're in your book? And so, to me, the distractions can be, like, set up, and there's just a lot of manual work to get things going. Yeah, yeah. Um, There might be other ideas. So, no, it wasn't so much like, hey, Dan, you're gonna become just another buyer. It's like you need to learn all the parts so you can manage the parts. Yeah, yeah. And that's that was, yeah, you know, my thought process. And so some of the reviews, like, have you learned the parts? What parts do you understand and what parts put you them? teach somebody to do like a marina. I'm not going to touch Catholic, you know, these, either help set up a system that coordinates this or help coordinate it until we're scaled to the number you want to scale to? Yeah. And so that's how I view it. So, I think he'll say this to you. setting up the campaigns is not doing well. Like, every one of them has been wrong. And so it's not that's not helpful. Like, if I have to go fix them anyways, I'd rather just do them or have someone else do them. Because, like, at the least you could do is set the campaign, right? Like that's a very easy, easy thing to do. So we're not following a certain guideline, or is it? I mean, I guess you could say that maybe I didn't give you the exact instructions, but when it's like a Canadian campaign and you set the target in the US, do I have to really have to tell you that? Like, I mean, maybe, maybe I do, but like, that's, you should just kind of know that. It's all things that are like sloppy. Let me just put it that way. It's like things that like, you're going too fast. You don't, you know, like, and something, it just isn't the wrong, the wrong, um, uh, domain or something is on there. Like, it's just stuff that you're going through that. not that you don't know how to do it. you're going quickly. And I think that he'll, I think that he'll say that, that's the truth because I think he's aware that they're all screwed up. Yeah, but if I want to go in there and again, I'm not sharing any of this. I want to go in there and like in my brain go, oh, you know, dance, Facebook, portfolio did $500 yesterday. Yeah. Should I actually like give him the benefit of the doubt? and be like, ooh, I'm gonna earmark that in this direction. Like, there's a part of me that's trying to figure out, like, what the fuck is our ROI? Right? Like, so that's that's something, because we... When he's not proven to manage in the way that we hope to manage our scale of business. unit that we hope can kind of, like, a bigger amount. While we worked on other things. And that just didn't move out. So now, in a way, his role keeps changing. He went from, like, okay, management, to, like, uh, your... And then the reality is, is that we're not really, like, a manager based company. No. I sit down and contribute. Narvay sits down and compared. Like, Narva's doing this dev calls, like, it's, we don't need an overseer. We need more contributions. So it's like, what can I, what are the highest leverage activities? What does he say that he sees his, like, what his day should be filled with? Is it, like, really fixing technical? Is it, like, doing all that? I feel like that's when they gravitate stories. Because there's not any like strict timeline on that stuff. You know what I mean? Oh, and I'm like, I've learned with people, like, you know, judge their actions, not their words. Yeah. And so I, you know, to be fair, he has set up, and he is contributing on media. Yeah. And he dipped his toe on the water with Facebook or better for worse. I'd like to have more confidence in that area. I believe there's more success. that we can gain in that area. And so, you know, I'm like, okay, here's a factory that needs to run, like, where's our factory? So do you think that he would be able... This goes back to the 1st thing that we asked him to do, which is like, hey, can you find categories that are running on internally on other platforms? Yeah, but we asked them to do that, and then, like, three days went by. Yeah, UN just did it yourself. I know, but yes, all that aside, though, that's something that's a small thing, but like, we need that done in a much bigger... Now that we don't have the keyboard, um, sheet from system one. We don't have any sort of like guidance from a new category. So, someone, we really could use somebody to go find other stuff for us to run. The way I could be like, scouring, we have 100s ads, like ad libraries. You can go through it. Like, there's a lot of ways to do it. And Marino, I was going to actually talk to Marine about that because it sort of fell into what she had sent, you and I earlier. It was just a different, a more focused way to do that. But we need help finding new stuff around. How would you envision that? So there's a Facebook ad library. There's ads in there. There's a number of ads in there, but they're all the same thing with different articles, so you'd almost have to look at the hook. I don't care. Honestly, I don't care about the. How do you identify a category that's working? Like, you have systematically think about this. You've got 100 ad libraries that hypothetically we can access. Then this, you know, perfect perfect person goes in there. Are they getting clocked out? No, it's still going? Oh, yeah, it is. So it's not as bad as the other one. This is how I interviewed my dad. Oh, yeah, yeah. And we went for like, until there's that, Oh yeah, this was... An hour. Yeah. And then there's an easy button that just hits transcript, and then I copy and paste this transcript, and I go to the AI, and I say, auto summarize. Like, basically autotranscribe and organize the whole conversation. And then I have all the points and then I can like trim it, go, okay, I don't have to forget about these things. It's fucking great. I'm gonna pause as well. Yep. Because I want to get here. But we can...

All right, so the idea of, is either have a person, no M, and review these ad libraries, or can I hit the API that I plugged in to that liftoff app to go and hit all these libraries? And then once they're in the library, what is it doing? Well... So one way to potentially figure out what's actually working is to search the ads by a certain date range. So you don't want to look at, like, any ads launch today or yesterday. You want to look at like ads up to like maybe a week ago? and then make sure that you're only looking at active ads, and it'll show you ads if you're still running. And I don't know what that exact time frame is, but it's been, say, 7 to 10 days, 32 weeks. don't know. But something in there. And then if they're still active and there's multiple ads, it probably means that that category is worth testing. I don't know if it's working, but, like, you could also, you could also scan it real quick, and this is not a human thing, but, like, it was, you could see, did they have new ads running for a category that was maybe launched? few months ago. If you're looking historically at it, then that would be an indicator that it's... that that category is working, which is wrong. So I, you know, and then do that across a lot of allies. Right. And then come up with a list. Okay, so now in those ad libraries, you have all these ads. Those ads typically are centered around, like, a certain category, like dental implants. Do you try to extract all the different hook angles? No. No. What if you see repetitive hook angles of the same category? Well, to be honest with you, I don't want to sit there and watch every video. I mean, it'll be like, sometimes it'll be like 30, 40, 50 videos. I'm not even gonna sit there and watch it. Okay, so that's one pale point is you're analyzing a video. So you have to be able to process and analyze the video. And then second, you have to be able to take the transcript from the video, and then you have to, so one thing that I have is a whole model of how to actually this great process and build a fast clone at... I don't have I don't I'll show it to you later. I haven't worked. I haven't built it, but one of the ideas was like, you know when you're like, hey, rip and run? I was more like, did you rip? Reskin and run. Yeah. I mean, that's yeah, I mean, that's essentially what Catherine was doing. I mean, so... But I don't think the hook is all that... really think that that's all that important. It's more like pick three. There's one thing you can look at in the videos that shows you that this is more likely to be working than the other ones. If it says, like, there's 5 versions of this ad, something like that. So if I see that on any ads, I, I'll those are the ones that I'll save before play. Okay, so when you say a version, is this like, it's got a video, it's got a text, it's got a version. Yeah, it's like, it's on Instagram, it's on Facebook. Yeah, it's like there's, yeah, there's different places for it. It's like different They may be modified it for different things, but it's like, it's the same ad, it just set up different ways. And some reason, they'll say, like, unique versions of this ad running. So what you're saying is, is like someone puts up an idea. As it versions, and as the number of versions or variants goes up, I don't know that that's even a right. You have a hunch that they put more work into it, so there was a reason why they put molar. My thought is like that angle's working for them until they're they're running it. And an angle in this context is a hook. And angle is a hook, and I don't, and that's the easiest part of this, really. It's like, if you're saving the ad into, let's say there's 10 ads in there, and they're all about dental implants. I don't need all 10 of them. I usually can, I'll pick 3 of them. One of those 3 will work if they had it really is gonna work. It's not like I need those all to be great ads. Now, let's say we find ads that we want to emulate. Do we also want to find their keyword blocks? I didn't get the keywords on them. Okay, so we got to find a way to backtrack. to the ad or the ad library. I'm just trying to think of a paper trail to go back and get the keyboard blocks. If they don't, if the ads are not, if they're not running a redirect, you can just get to get it right from the URL. Oh, you can scrape the URL and get the abs. Okay, so that's a good idea. But a lot of people run the redirect, and if that's the case, you can't see the... And do you have a big list of these that you're maintaining? Yeah, and there's exponentially more. Like, if I wanted to, I could say, like, 100 of them this week. no, that's fine. Okay, so that's that's interesting. Okay, so then one thing hypothetically Dan could do is come up with more ideas. Right? Yeah, and, like, and, like, centralize them somewhere so that, like, kind of like we're doing that sheet, it's the same thing. It's just, like, I'm not doing it. How much of your time do you spend doing that? I mean, right now, not that much, because I don't have, like, I'm kind of, don't know what categories are. You get to a certain point where I'm like, I don't have a, I don't have like a compet for a new category. Okay, so then, what do we have to do? What is the most, what's, what's the most efficient path and the highest leverage activities we need to do to scale to 10 grand a day? Well, one thing that's working really well is going international on things that are working. So, like, taking our current categories and running them in other English speaking countries. That's immediately improved everything. So would that be a strategy that Dan can help accelerate with Marina? Assuming we have an accurate deployment process where they're not getting a bunch of fucking messed up campaigns. Um, yeah, and I mean, if, like, I was thinking also, we're gonna put milk somewhere. Bill's really good. I hate international stuff. I hate it. Okay. Especially if you put in a different language, if the translator or whatever, that's not. Okay, yeah, Phil can go Facebook International. They'll know how to set stuff up on Facebook. I think, yes, but not he's not fluent in Facebook. I just saw him, he did one campaign with me a long time ago. I think he wants to have a call. So, but I didn't, I don't know, I didn't know the direction to point him. So I was kind of like, we just kind of came up with a good one. potentially. I mean, look, what I need to do is talk to Phil and see if he feels like his opportunities are dry. I think he does because you wouldn't just reach out to me randomly. Okay. That's fair. Um, and I think like, that's one thing we don't have anybody doing. Any other things that immediately come to mind to go from thought five? I know we did more than five, but 5 to 10. Is it new categories that you like this, this kind of, yeah. I mean, we need more categories for sure. Like, that's something that, like, we need to keep guessing categories. And without that system one, cheat, I don't have a great... Well, we just talked about is one way to do it, which is like, I think it takes a lot more work. It's gonna be, uh, there's not gonna be the fruit of that labor. Like we know in that system one sheet that those categories are working, that's the beauty of it. So it's not like you're spinning your tires, you're putting a sub that may or may not work. It's more like, yeah, raising the hit rate on the category. Hello. You're not gonna keep that recording, Howard?

## Key Facts Mentioned (quick capture)

- Company is contribution-oriented; minimize management layers
- Repeated setup errors (geo, domains) blocking confidence and scale
- Need systematic category discovery via FB Ad Library/API; use signals (active 7–10d, multiple versions)
- International expansion of winners is working; consider Phil for FB International
- Dan to focus on accurate setup and category discovery; coordinate with Marina
