### Facebook Discovery Pipeline + Iterate

```
don't mind. All right, discovering the, all right, so Facebook discovery, pipeline, and iterate. So what? We're feeding effectively data to either. These are both Google, so the image is nano banana. Gemini 2.5. And the video is VO 3.one. Google's most recent model for video generation. Isn't that gonna get, like, really expensive? I don't know yet. That I'll worry about after. Okay. And so, At some point, like, Grock's imagine is going to be available, but right now, um... What's that? 2 is really good. Sora 2? Okay. For now, I was just like, can I take... Can I create the magic in the background, right? Can I literally get competitive intel, pull it in, take a hook, and from that hook, grab all the assets related to the things that we stored, and then produce new assets. iterate on that and produce our own version. So it's gonna stay more potentially true to the hook, but it's gonna create new assets. So the intention is like, Now that you know how this works, I want you to look at the output, tell me how you would imagine you, if you were to go do it what you would do, and then criticize this so that I can do a better job. Well, where did what's it basing? Because isn't it copying an image that it thinks as a winner or images? Did you say that to him so? Potentially. I got to go back. gonna take whatever ad, asset values it has, and then it's gonna have, it's gonna run through its own like model to then produce an output. Because my my thought would be that's not very good to add, but if the ad that is, it's based off of is a winning ad somewhere. Then maybe it is, but. Really know that what we know is that this is a cluster of ads that have run for a period of time, but are related to a hook that. Okay, then my 2nd thing would be the that's not is that so that's a hook. That it's too specific so like that's a Botox hat. Yep. So it would be like Botox treatments and surprisingly low prices. Uh, and then the Jupiter thing would be gone at the bottom. Yep. And in the actual ad text, we should have no brand text. So Jupiter, Jupiter, and Lobos, or even made up logos of the Jupiter. Yeah, and I think I'm guessing Jupiter was a big keyword, and that's why I did that. No, because it's actually calling out Jupiter and the ad copy in the transcript. I'm pretty sure the juvenile's in the text of the transcript. It's not using the word Botox. I think this is a juviderm call out. Oh, I wonder if that's an actual Jupiter Manhattan. or not in our bed. It's an R bad. Oh, it is? I have to go. Okay, so one thing, one feature that might be nice is like, we go through, let's say we're like just scrolling through 100s of these and you see something like, oh, that looks weird. You'd like to see potentially like can we see the originating assets that derived this outcome? Well, I would just want to know what that is up front. Like it's somewhat just, I don't need to do it every time and you want to say, are they pulling it from the right things to begin with? Because this would make you not trust it. Yeah, that I would think that that came from like a professional ad. That looks like a professional ad, I don't know that. Okay. Um, It's very, like, stock flow, though. Yep. You know, it's like that's not something to work on our tradition. Okay. Um, so... If this was the ad that your assistant came and was like, look, Ben, this is, you wanted me to launch this Jupiter and Botox campaign. Just Botox. Sure. Okay, so, yeah. this Botox campaign and you're like, 0 shit. Yeah, I would say that's something like some people, like the people who have come to Adnet from agencies, that's the type of... So what do we want to avoid? What's the problem with this? It's it's it's. Stack Fogey, that's okay. Two. Too polished, 2 stock photo. So things that are more what? Candid, everyday looking people. I like fat women and pictures. Okay, so candid every day. Yeah, more or less like everyday woman, the more I look like just took a thing with an iPhone. So images that are taken with like just regular normal iPhones, not overprocessed. Okay. images that, like, if it's Botox, you want it to be something like, uh, probably it would probably be like something up close to the needle, like something to grouch your attention. Okay, so something that really catches me. Yeah, it wouldn't just be human. Like, without, like, just standing there like that. Okay, so for example, like this is like, hey, look how great the outcome is. This is more like, oh my gosh, what is that? Oh, but that's how I get to the outcome. Okay. Do you put calls to action in the image? Sometimes. How often? I try to say 60% of them. Okay, so good enough to learn more and all that stuff is reasonable. We'll have to see what this URL is, but like the actual techna pages, URL under the call to action. I don't know why it's doing that. And also the What about the image formats? Yeah, that's what I was going to say. I think the... The way it's split down the middle like that, like you want to have like a block of text at the top or the bottom, and that, and there's too much text on that one. Okay. But if we were getting rid of everything except for juvenile treatments and surprise on low prices. For instance, yep, then there would be room to just slap that on the top. Okay, so you've got kind of 3 components, the headline, the subheadline, and the call that. Yeah, you don't even have to have necessarily text on it. you know, so like there's that dude. You just have a picture. Okay, so some variants could just be a picture and the text is done in the actual ad copy of the ad. Yeah, or, but also, like, we just had an ad, the only ad we can make work on impression clinical trials is an all text ad. It just didn't look depression, medical trials and like black and white letters like was sad. Anything else we try doesn't work so like there's other instances where you only want text on a cape. So just like big text on and on desktop, you mean texts looked great. Like mostly just text, so. Okay. That's interesting. Alright, let's is there any other thing that comes to mind right now? If we were like somehow magically, so you'd probably want more than one variant to look at. So you're like, oh, I'd like some options. Like if you were just to kind of like go, oh, I'm going to select one with no edits and run. Like the idea is that maybe we can make these outputs better, and then over time there's less kind of edits, and there's a higher hit rate of you wanting to use an ad that's done fully autonomous, autonomously. Yeah, right? My thought is that this is just pulling from ads that aren't necessarily. That's why I was curious, though, where they're playing from. I wondering. So you may really want to strongly reference. I just want to see it like once before. Okay, yeah. Because maybe that's where the disconnect is? It makes sense. It's pulling from as it are not actually... All right, video. real quick. So... Wait, wait, you haven't seen this one? Oh, you saw a woman? I sent you one, but I'm curious because this one, look, so this was, I didn't have a way to like export it. You've been doing treatments and surprisingly, low prices. Right, so, that was, like, the first one that it ever fucking spit out. Yep. I basically had to spit out another one, but clearly there's a different, um, uh, character. It's probably going to say the same exact thing. Because I think what it did was it took the transcript and that was creating a different... Julian treatments and surprisingly low prices. All right, the good, bad, ugly. Yeah, that's way too polished. Like that is like like the stuff that works for videos is like it. A bunch of really short clips of different things. So if you have 8 seconds, what do you eat by shortcut? Well, okay. How long are you being? No, the 8 seconds is fine. Is there a range? Like, you want to make a video between... Like, I, if I'm making the video, I'm making sure, because I don't want to have to, like, add much. Well, the other thing I don't know is how advanced VO is and how long these videos could be before you start messing. VO might be tuned perfectly for 8 seconds and you try to make it 12 and the whole thing fails. Yeah, I've never done a dual segment. Okay, so 8 seconds, but you would chop 8 seconds up into how many different scenes. Um, Eight seconds out. I mean, maybe 2 at the most at the most. Okay, so 2 scenes. Yeah. Hold on. going to do this live. Okay, so 2 scenes and what else? Give me some other notes on, like, let's say let's say we wanted to rerun this video output, and we're gonna give it some feedback, right? So can you please rerun the video output for the Jubiter ad? We'd like it to contain 2 scenes and not one. What else? What I always type into, the, when I make a video and through a tool, I'd say like it needs a, it needs to be candid, and it looks like it was taken to an iPhone. It needs to be candid and look like it was taken with an iPhone at least 2 versions ago. Yeah, that's good. You can say something every day. No, see, like should the character be a female? I wouldn't even use character, honestly. that's, I mean. Well, then what would you do? Maybe like maybe like do like a needle going into their face or something. Okay, on one of the scenes, we need a close-up of a needle going into the face applying Botox. Yeah. What else? And then the second, you'd be something like, like the, that same area that's giving the treatment, like, like post that, yeah. Okay, so the 2nd scene of the video clip is you pan and zoom out to the same area that was being worked on and you can see the after effect. Let's just see what the fuck happens. Yeah. That's, yeah. I mean, this is all very one off, but my question, my curiosity is, is like you have like style preferences because I have templates. Yeah, right? And then eventually, like, the question is, is how would you interact with this later? I would ultimately be curious about what video it's using to create the original video or what videos. Usually the ones that are scaled, they wouldn't be anything like that. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, and so I think it was. So you want to see the before video versus you want to see like the ad that it's recreated? But how many, if you've got to go through 400 of these? Yeah, no, I mean, how do you scale this? Or you just, you do like the 1st like 20, you start to find some common themes and then eventually you trust it to go. And then you just look at the outputs and then you just, you gotta go back and reverse engineer the ones you don't like. I mean, maybe it's like, yeah, it's, like, you're building your own, like, ad builder, where it's, like, using your own winning ads to make new ads. As opposed to like taking ads that are in other people's ads, like or ad letters and make the ad. Does that make sense? Like, we fed it like 20 or ads or something. I don't know if that's even possible, but you. Of course we can. As this system gets more complicated, yes, we can do really quickly. But does that make it more complicated or less complicated? I don't know. Let's just see if what this does. Because what I'm curious, like, I'm just impressed that I got it to do this. I mean, yeah, that's what it is. like the technology. Considering this is in my own environment, like, I'm not on, if you notice, I'm not on Google's website. I'm actually, so, our system I call the attention engine. Because basically we're buying and selling attention. Oh yeah, that, yeah. So I coined the project, the attention engine. which is, like, encompasses, like, strategists. It's just for fun for me. So we have, like, if I go to this tool, I'm like, hey, you bring up the attention engine. We're going to work on this part. Um, Now, what was interesting was this was smart enough to override, so it says, look, I added a custom prompt override, right? So clearly they're, is a templative prompt. So there's a system behind it. So that's why I'm like, if I can break apart this process, that's why I was trying to, I did this with Narbe earlier, because I got him in a big conversation and he like dove into a wormhole where he was like, oh, these are the, you know, these are all the different hooks and angles, we're running all these different ads, and it's inside of an ad, and then when you go over here, it goes from a, uh, a, you know, a lead to a, a book to point, you know, to a whatever, what's the call ratio, the, um, Whatever, you know, 20% need to get on a phone call, and then we got a, we got a book to 2 and then we got a sale and like, you know, we're gonna track all those micro details all the way back to that. I'm like, no, no, no, Harvey, that's great. I wanted to hear about that. I'm just fucking around with the blue box in between. Arb starts with an ad and ends with a click. I'm building the blue box. Like, you could talk all day here and you could talk all day. Maybe one day I'll build it, but I'm just building the blue box. So in the same way, my 1st goal was to turn this into just a simple box, you know, box. Can I get an ad output it from X? Now all of a sudden I'm like, oh, I can. How do we make this box a little bit better? Send it out to us. We've got a new video. Dun, dun, dun. Oh, okay. better. Okay, yeah, that's definitely better. I mean, it's on the right track. Okay. It's definitely better. Like, it feels like it's, like, a real person, and dude, the first thing is, like, I mean, the needle syringe is juvenile on it. Huh? That's good. But when Facebook even show that ad? Yeah, their policy is pretty much wrong. Like, they have no... Okay, so the thing that changed on this ad is we no longer have like an audio voiceover. Oh true. So we didn't talk about like, you know, should audio voiceovers carry? The other thing is, is that there's there's subtitles. Jupiter treatments available now. Surprisingly low prices. Captions, no captions. Yeah, captions are good. So always have captions. Don't always have captions. Do variants with like... I mean, I would always have the options. Okay, so hypothetically in the beginning, we always have captions. Any other thoughts besides? I'm going to ask for Ruccio, because I know Vio doesn't do verticals. I don't believe. And so that's a little bit of a challenge. Okay, so what is the aspect ratio that we need? Uh, I, uh, whatever the vertical is, like, I don't know the exact, no, I don't have no hotel, and whatever vertical is, it's like nine, six. Okay, so we need hold on. Okay. Okay. Facebook aspect, uh, video ad aspect. For what? For, uh, vertical. Yeah, I'm not 100% true what it is. fine. All right, so we're gonna do this again. We're now going to want to create a 3rd variant of this ad for video. A stories and reels, full vertical, or full screen vertical ad is 9 by 16. So we need to convert the video to a 916 format. We want to keep the captions on. What else did we want to do with this video? There was a lot you might. Ah, can you please add back in the voiceover? Any else? Now, here's a question. Mm hmm. Well, this is working. You're, like, massaging this video ad, right? And you're like, ah, this is pretty close. Is there text that goes in this ad too? I would consider the text caption. Yeah, but when you load it in the Facebook, do you have what else do you have to put it in with the video? Oh, yeah. Okay, so you need all that to carry through. So maybe you need to see those components while you're working on this. Uh, maybe, but that, like, that stuff is so simple. I mean, I don't know. No, just work with me here. Now you're like, I like this ad. What's next? You kind of already set up the campaign. Do you do the ad before or after the campaign? Or now you gotta go set it all up, right? How are you setting it up? Ballpark. You mean in strategies or in Facebook? Yeah, you're like, I fucking love this ad. Imagine this is the ad you're like, I want to run this. I gonna go on an ad set? Is it gonna go into a pre-existing asset? Is it gonna be? Yeah, it'll be like a campaign stooped and then... Okay, so your pattern is you're gonna go dupa campaign because you don't want to go through the effort of having to set up a campaign from scratch. Right? You'll already have like a juvederm campaign pointed to like a certain. doesn't have to be... or Botox. It could be a, it doesn't, because I just do anything that's in that account and then just change the ad. That's it? I mean, What about the naming conventions at all? Yeah, you have to do it, but I'm saying like, yeah, you don't just change it. I mean, like, you have to change everything in that, but it doesn't matter what, like, it could be any, any campaign. Okay. It's a little easier, if it's the same, but like it's not... And then you just go to the adult, you just go and you go download the video and then upload it to Facebook and then, um, and then and then run it. All right, let's see what, let's see what our next ad is gonna look like. And is this the process that takes you too long? that you kind of get lost in? Sometimes, I mean, I do want to hand this process off to somebody, like Catherine. So, I mean, I also realize, like, the way that the reason that I get Boston sometimes is because this is what, like, my brain likes to do, and so it's just one of those things where it's hard for me not to do it better. Or else I'm just always doing the parts that I don't like to do. Humiderm treatment at surprisingly low prices refresh your look today. Yeah, whole name. Look your appointment. That does it all the time. I had to, like... You have a German treatment, and surprisingly, low price... It does just, like... Refreshing, looking... Look. Put the iPhone screen on there. Okay, so we got to make sure that... We can translate, like, technically how a video would look if it was shot by an iPhone, but not actually use the word iPhone in a prompt. So we gotta fix that. Okay, so that's interesting. And clearly it did not produce a 19 by 6 Oh, video. How do you format a video? I don't think you can. what I'm saying. Are we able to I don't think crop. The other problem with this one... The subtitles came out all wonky. Does that happen a lot? Okay, so there's a concern that subtitles can get messed up because they come out in Swahili. Um, Okay. I think we have enough to work on for right now. And I also know that I would use VO. Like, I think because of all the issues it had, like it's if you're mainly doing it, you could, you can get it there, but it's got a lot of issues. BO does. So which one doesn't have a lot of issues? Sora? No, they all have their own problems. Like, you can't do voiceover on most of them. That's why V is the best. But that's why I said Catherine, because then she can just go do exactly like she knows. She just pulls to the clips. The videos at work are clips, the people are stealing from like Instagram and TikTok, and then piecing together and making a video out. Usually about 15 seconds. They're like, bam, bam, bam, like 5 clips, 5 different clips and 152nd video. But you're not doing this. Yeah, we are. That's what I have to make. Okay, so Cat, so you make 82nd videos, but Catherine makes 15 second videos. Yeah, if I'm testing something, I don't I can't do that. It's impossible. It takes like. Okay, so you forever. So... If you're gonna test, the 1st instinct of this, like, we're gonna find something in the wild, we're gonna want to iterate on it, and we're gonna want to just see what happens. That's typically like an, you know, 82nd video. Uh, no, because, I mean, the ones that we take from the wild could be 15 seconds. Oh, okay. Okay, so that also, so the question is, is if we're emulating a particular video, what is the length of that particular video? and understanding that? Yeah, and I mean, honestly, and that's what I'm saying. I think that the easiest way to do this, maybe ultimately like say, hey, and again, you're better at this stuff than I am by my, but like, here's our, here's 40 videos that work. We want videos like this. And I don't know that I don't know that they can even make those videos. I really don't. I think they're they're not. Well, another question is, do we get some of these videos? We run a model over it to say like, Explain why this video works. Clearly we have statistical evidence that this video works. You have 40 videos that work. Can you write to us explicitly why they work? And then we can create a pattern from that and then we can use that to produce other videos with those concepts. Yeah, but I, I, maybe, but I don't know where it would get the clothes. It's really hard to get those clips, right even like one as you can see, much less if you put 5 in one short video. It's it's really tricky. We may not be able to do this process, right? So what I decided was, can it spit something out? And today it was just like, hey, let me get a 1st round. Like right now we have a, a, largely either copy and use or strong human in the loop process, right? I'm not saying we can close that gap or maybe the real pathway is to queue this up in a way where it's easier for Catherine to rip more of them out. making this up, right? Um, maybe it's more, Yeah, like I don't know where this leads, but I know that it could have, like, we've already proven that it could be better than what we started with. So if we naturally have like, for example, if this is like, we got to think about the creative process of iterate. Like iterate has its own, like, broken out parts that help it create something, right? Like, one of the jobs is like, go get all the information on the assets. Another job is gonna be like, hey, here's our templating system of how to tell these models how to create variants, right? Like, I need 3 variants per this. I need to output them like that, so they're easy to watch. Like, and then the 3rd part is, you know, you gotta do the creative part, and it sucks at that part, but that, if we solve the other 2 of the 3 parts, then maybe Catherine makes 3 times. Yeah, it's also better than actually clear. It's not like everybody will use is that same format. There's one particular format that probably is more often seen in the better ads. There's the second one is the image image to video stuff where you just take a really cool image and you turn to that into a video, which video three can do very well. I think that's what this did. It took an image in turn. Yeah, okay. Um, I think that 1st video. So, again, if it's taking a polished image. So the question is, is like, how do we make it more true to the concept of the image that it starts from? So how do you analyze the originating image? Right? Like what's in it, what is it composed of? What is the like the aesthetic lens of that image, right? Like, does it look like it was shot by a Polaroid camera or a 4K, $80,000 camera and a commercial shoot? And then, can we turn those things into templated prompts so that they know how to like recreate something that has those elements? Can you see the original versus the output? And again, I'm not saying I'm delivering any of this. I'm gonna, of all these ideas and things we're talking about, I'm gonna log them, print them out, and see what I can rip and run quickly. Yeah, and again, I don't think that we necessarily just see the original all the time. Just like, we just, as long as we know that we're getting the proper originals, by the way that we're upsetting this thing up. Like, so then you only check every time and once you see it do it 5 times correctly, you're like, okay, now it's getting... of course. Uh, okay. This was really all I needed. Okay. I'm just nudging different areas.
```

### Facebook Co Pilot

```
Okay, we're at our co-pilot. Now Ben's shocked because he shows up. He's not, he doesn't like this. No, I just don't even know what we're talking about. Okay. Okay, you're about to start going in and figuring out Arb for the day. Well, say you haven't looked at it all day. It's 8 o'clock at night or whenever you want. What's the 1st thing you do? Uh, look at the dashboard. Okay, so you go to the dashboard. And what are you trying to see in the dashboard? Just, you know, we're all, like, feel where things are at, but anything's, like, way off. Okay, so you want to, you're gonna look at, like, your overall Roas to Facebook, to your campaigns, anything you're managed. Are you looking at it? Just individual campaigns, to see if, like, and I mean, maybe I would answer that while it's there, but really it's like, is he individual campaigns or anything's, like, really great or really terrible? Okay, so what's really great? Uh, we've dental, let's say, dental is really great. Oh, my God. What makes it great? Uh, if in the morning, in the mornings it would be like if it's already profitable or if it's, no, no, we're not booking. not doing intraday decisions. We're purely looking from a reconcile point of view. Okay, then. Okay, let me back out of this a little bit. Then I'm looking at the dashboard still. Yep. You're looking at the dashboard. But, um, I sort by, uh, most conversions to least, and then I... Okay, so you want to know highest volume? Yeah, like, or if spend, like, whatever you spend. And then, and then, and then, uh, look at, basically look at, I look at CBA versus RPC and Roaz. There's the only thing that would... You leave all those columns are there, that's the only thing. So you're trying to understand the CPA relative to, is it in line where it's been? Is it going up? What is it not? Yeah, really, though, I'm looking at, like, where does it stand versus the RBC today? Okay, so where does the CPA relative to the Roas, right? No, the CBA relative of the RBC. Oh, relatively the RPC, and then the Rowas is... And then you're looking 1st for outliers, right? The 1st thing you want to do is go find... No, that was interesting. That was interesting. So, like, this would be `this is different. Okay, you you saddle up, you go to your dashboard. 400 assets running. Yeah. Yeah. And then, I mean, then I think it definitely sort, but... Okay, so you want you want high volume first? Yeah, 80-20. I wanna know what's impacting 80% of my performance right now. Yeah, and if there was 400, I would probably be this little bit differently. I'd probably just only look at Roaz and just be like, I'm gonna rip through these things really quick. Yeah, but okay, but like what's what's what's really good? Uh, 160%, 160% or more. Okay, and then, so that's, we'll call that like outstanding. Okay, what's the next bandwidth? 140 to 160 is good. Okay. Oh, great. What's, what's, so you're now 140, 160? What's your next bandwidth? Then it'd be a 120 to 140? 120, and then break even to whatever. And then would you run the same bandwidth on the inverse and the negative? I mean, nothing really loses that much these days. I mean, like, there's so few campaigns that lose much that you don't look at those in the same way. Okay. Um, but you'll, Anything losing, I actually look at, probably more so than what's going, because that kind of bothers me, and you kind of want to figure out, like, what's going on here. Yep. And loss is more looked at as total loss. Yeah, I don't look at like a particular thing necessarily. You're not looking at percentages, you're like, it lost 50 bucks. like, if it was like 80 bucks, I'm like, what happened? That seems like really bad to me. It lost like 200 then I was like whoa. Okay, so you have this. let's just say right now. She's feeding you. It's just taking you through like your coffee ritual, right? It's like, hey, Ben, we just reviewed the, you know, top, uh, 10 campaigns or 10 assets were over 160. What do you want to do with those? Do you do you treat them all the same? you're not? No, because, um, it's the, like, Lena, I was looking at, it depends on like the budget it already is, but it's high. I'm not gonna raise it by 100%. Gotcha. I said a bunch of just like a 1000 bucks. Yeah, you're gonna, you're gonna be more careful. But it's $100 and I am going to put it. Okay, and then on the flip side, let's say that you, you know, you see a campaign, it's lost 100 bucks. What are you gonna do? That I'm going to look at the actual campaign. Like, I mean, Facebook. Okay, so you're at that point you're out of the numbers. Are you in you're in the numbers when it's positive and you're out of the numbers when it's negative? Yeah, if it's working, I don't go. I usually don't go like at the campaign to figuring it because it's working. Okay, so when it's not working, you need a quick way to get to why is it not working? Okay. End the session. Okay.
