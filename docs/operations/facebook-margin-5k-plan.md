# Facebook $5K/Day Margin Plan

**Objective**: Reach $5,000/day net margin within 30 days (from current $2,017/day baseline).

**Current State** (Oct 7 data):
- Daily spend: $8,236 | Daily margin: $2,017 | Margin rate: 24.5%
- Top drivers: Dental Implant Trials ($1,000+ combined margin), TJ's Credit Cards Canada
- Team capacity: 7-11 new campaigns/week, 33-50% hit rate, 3-5 day decision windows

**Path to $5K/Day Margin**:
- Need ~$20,400/day spend at current 24.5% margin rate
- Or $16,300/day spend at 30.7% margin rate (improved efficiency)

## Phase 1: Scale Existing Winners (Days 1-7)
**Target**: +$2,500 margin/day from scaling proven campaigns

### Dental Implant Trials Scaling
- **Ben's top campaigns**: simt3jv06u3 ($278 margin on $710), sifwtl0648 ($249 margin on $709)
- **TJ's top campaigns**: si8xed06p3 ($57 margin on $91), sifsl206dx ($22 margin on $82)
- **Scaling rules** (TJ's ROAS-based approach):
  - ROAS ≥130%: +40% budget/day
  - ROAS 100-129%: +20% budget/day
  - ROAS 80-100%: Hold/reduce 20%/day
  - ROAS <80%: Drop 50%/day or pause
- **Week 1 target**: Ben +$1,000/day spend ($250 margin), TJ +$500/day spend ($125 margin)

### Credit Card Canada Scaling
- **TJ's campaigns**: sinvhr06zg ($-19 margin), sibz32j06tg ($23 margin), siav14706az ($-9 margin)
- **Week 1 target**: +$300/day spend across winners ($80 margin)

### Automotive/Home Value Scaling
- **TJ's winners**: sig41qa06pf ($30 margin), siv4qd06j2 ($35 margin)
- **Week 1 target**: +$200/day spend ($50 margin)

## Phase 2: Launch New Campaigns (Days 1-14)
**Target**: 21-27 new Dental Implant campaigns this week

### Launch Capacity by Buyer
- **TJ**: 7-8 campaigns/week (1-1.5/day), 4+ break-even in 72hrs
- **Ben**: 3-5 campaigns/week (0.4-0.7/day across team)
- **Dan**: 2-3 campaigns/week (focus on proven categories)
- **Mike**: 1-2 campaigns/week (after cutting negatives)
- **Anastasia**: 0 new launches (focus on optimization)

### Launch Strategy
- **Vertical focus**: 80% Dental Implant Trials, 20% Credit Cards/Home Value
- **Creative testing**: 1-3 ad sets, 1-6 ad variations per campaign
- **Decision framework**:
  - Monitor 72hrs for break-even
  - Scale winners per ROAS rules above
  - Kill losers immediately (<80% ROAS)

## Phase 3: Optimize & Cut Waste (Ongoing)
**Target**: Free up $500+/day budget for scaling

### Immediate Cuts
- **Mike's campaigns**: All negative margin (-$15 on $189 spent) → Pause/kill
- **Anastasia low-performers**: Reduce 50% budget on sub-$50 margin campaigns
- **TJ's losers**: Pause ROAS <80% campaigns

### Ongoing Optimization
- **Creative refresh**: Rotate ad variations weekly on scaling campaigns
- **Audience expansion**: Test new geo/interest targeting on winners
- **Budget reallocation**: Move $ from losers to winners daily

## Phase 4: Infrastructure & Metrics (Week 1)
**Target**: Automated reporting and human management system

### Strateg.is Reporting PRD
- **Metrics to add**:
  - Launch throughput (campaigns/day by owner)
  - Hit rate (% break-even in 72hrs)
  - Time-to-scale/kill decisions
  - ROAS distribution and scaling recommendations
- **Automations**:
  - Daily scaling alerts based on ROAS rules
  - Weekly performance summaries
  - Budget optimization suggestions

### Human Control System
- **AI Manager Loop**: Weekly check-ins with each buyer
- **Roster**: Ben, TJ, Dan, Mike, Anastasia (active), plus 4 others (roles TBD)
- **KPIs per buyer**: Margin contribution, launch success rate, scaling efficiency
- **Management cadence**: Weekly async check-ins, bi-weekly syncs

## Success Metrics & Milestones

### Weekly Targets
- **Week 1**: $3,000/day margin (+$1,000 vs baseline)
- **Week 2**: $4,000/day margin (+$2,000 vs baseline)
- **Week 3**: $5,000/day margin (target achieved)
- **Week 4**: $6,000/day margin (optimization phase)

### Key Indicators
- **Daily margin**: Track vs $5K target
- **Spend efficiency**: Maintain ≥24% margin rate
- **Launch success**: ≥40% campaigns break-even in 72hrs
- **Scaling velocity**: Winners growing 20-40%/day per ROAS rules

## Risk Mitigation
- **Cash flow**: Monitor daily spend vs revenue lag (3-5 day delay)
- **Platform risk**: Diversify across multiple ad accounts/owners
- **Creative fatigue**: Rotate creatives weekly, test new angles
- **Competition**: Monitor category saturation, pivot if needed

## Resource Requirements
- **Team bandwidth**: 20-30 hours/week new launches + daily optimization
- **Budget headroom**: $12,000+/day capacity available (current $8K/day)
- **Tools**: strateg.is reporting endpoint, automated scaling alerts

**Execution**: Start with scaling existing winners (immediate impact), parallel new launches, cut waste to fund growth. Monitor daily, adjust weekly.
