# 61 — Promotion • Prune • Scale (Mon/Thu Cadence)

A single, deterministic SOP that **promotes** winners, **prunes** losers, and **preps scale** without fragmenting learning.

---

## 1) Eligibility & Scoring (per ad, 7d window unless noted)

**Eligibility (must pass all):**
- `sessions ≥ 2,000`  
- `events/ad set/week ≥ 50` on destination lane (or on pace)  
- `spent ≥ $50` and `≥ 3 purchases` **or** vRPS uplift ≥ +30% vs acct median  
- Destination lane won’t breach **15 ads** (hard cap); target **≤12**

**Primary score (promote rank):**
\[
\textbf{Score} = 0.7 \cdot \text{vRPS\_uplift\_vs\_median} + 0.2 \cdot \text{purchases\_z} + 0.1 \cdot \text{vRPS\_slope\_3d}
\]
- `vRPS_uplift_vs_median = per_session_vRPS / account_median_vRPS - 1`
- `purchases_z` = standardized within lane
- `vRPS_slope_3d` = 3-day linear trend (winsorized)

**Kill/Prune criteria (any true):**
- `spent ≥ $150` and `purchases = 0` (prospecting)  
- `CPA > ad-set median CPA + 25%` for **48h**  
- Fatigue: `freq > 3.0` **and** `CTR WoW ≤ −20%`  
- Bottom **60%** of Sandbox by score

---

## 2) Promotion Targets (how many to move)

Respect ad-set caps by doing **1:1 swaps** when near the limit.

| Lane (destination) | New ads per batch (typical) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| **ASC — Broad** | 8–12 | Mix ≥ 6 distinct hooks; maintain format diversity (9:16 ≥ 40%, 4:5 ≥ 30%, 1:1 ≥ 20%) |
| **LAL 1% (stability)** | 6–8 | Only **proven** winners; max **3 LPIDs** active in this lane |
| **LAL 2–5%** | 4–6 | Graduates that performed in LAL 1% |
| **Contextual** | 4–6 | Only if stack’s vRPS ≥ +10% vs acct median |
| **Warm** | 2–4 | Gentle reminders; frequency discipline |

## 3) Batch Flow (Mon/Thu, account timezone)

**T-60 min — Gates & Freeze Check**
1. **Signal:** `EMQ p50 ≥ 5`, `latency p50 ≤ 300s`, dedup ok  
2. **Learning:** `events/ad set/week ≥ 50` or on pace  
3. **Economics:** `Session ROAS (7d) ≥ 1.30×`  
4. **Cooldown:** last change ≥ 24h ago on targeted entities

If any **red**, abort; create **FIX tickets** (signal repair / consolidation / page refresh).

**T-45 min — Compose Plans**
- Pull `creative_candidates_view`
- Build **promotion_plan** using score & caps
- Build **prune_plan** (kill list + 1:1 swaps)
- Build **rotation_plan** for fatigue (replace 3–5 creatives where triggered)
- Validate **Sandbox share** remains **13–20%** post-batch

**T-30 min — Simulate**
- Simulate delivered ads per ad set after changes (stay ≤ 15, target ≤12)
- Simulate **events/week** run-rate post-prune (stay ≥ 50)
- Simulate **Session ROAS** sensitivity with conservative lift (+10% on promoted units only)

**T-15 min — Dry Run (Terminal)**
- Publish `dry_run=true` **terminal_intents_batch**; verify guards

**T-0 — Execute**
- Publish `dry_run=false` intents
- Write **change_log** (entity, before→after, reasons, gates snapshot)

**T+24h — Cooldown
