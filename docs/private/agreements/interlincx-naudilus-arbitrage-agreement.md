Interlincx Media Corp. × Naudilus LLC — Media Arbitrage Services Agreement

Effective Date: [__________]

This Media Arbitrage Services Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between Interlincx Media Corp. ("Interlincx") and Naudilus LLC ("Naudilus"). Interlincx and Naudilus are each a "Party" and, collectively, the "Parties."

1. Purpose and Scope
The Parties desire to collaborate on the Google search arbitrage business, where revenue is collected upstream and flows through the following chain: Google → System One → Interlincx → Naudilus → [downstream partner(s)]. Under this Agreement, Interlincx acts as the System One contract holder and revenue recipient from System One, and Naudilus serves as financial intermediary and distributor of funds to downstream partners as described herein.

2. Roles and Responsibilities
2.1 Interlincx
- Holds the underlying commercial relationship with System One for the Google arbitrage program.
- Receives revenue remittances from System One for qualifying traffic/revenue.
- Provides Naudilus with commercially reasonable reporting related to amounts received and any adjustments (including chargebacks, clawbacks, refunds, invalid activity, or policy deductions).
- Remits amounts to Naudilus as set forth in Section 3.

2.2 Naudilus
- Acts as intermediary for onward distribution of funds to designated downstream partners (e.g., Adnet LLC) in accordance with Section 3.
- Provides reconciliation to Interlincx on amounts received from Interlincx and amounts paid to downstream partners.
- Coordinates operational finance, including application of adjustments, offsets, and chargebacks, in line with upstream statements.

3. Money Flow; Payment Terms
3.1 Flow of Funds. Revenue collected from Google via System One shall be paid by System One to Interlincx. Interlincx will then pay Naudilus, and Naudilus will distribute amounts to downstream partner(s) (e.g., Adnet) as applicable.

3.2 Pay-As-Paid; Timing. Interlincx shall remit to Naudilus on a pay-as-paid basis within [5] business days after Interlincx’s actual receipt of cleared funds from System One for the relevant period. Interlincx has no obligation to advance or pay amounts not actually received from System One.

3.3 Adjustments. All payments are subject to adjustments reflected by System One or Google (including but not limited to refunds, credits, chargebacks, clawbacks, invalid activity, policy violations, spam/fraud deductions, or later-accruing offsets). Interlincx may net such adjustments against current or future amounts; where netting is not feasible, Naudilus shall promptly refund or permit off-set of any overpaid amounts.

3.4 Fees/Costs. The Parties may agree in writing on any intermediary fees, platform fees, or other costs (if any) payable to Naudilus for services rendered under this Agreement. Any such fees shall be clearly stated in an order form, statement of work, or addendum referencing this Agreement.

3.5 Taxes. Each Party is responsible for its own taxes arising from payments under this Agreement, except for taxes Interlincx is required by law to withhold, which will be withheld and remitted as required. The Parties will cooperate to furnish appropriate tax documentation (e.g., W-9/W-8).

4. Compliance; Quality; Policies
Each Party shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and upstream platform policies, including System One and Google policies. Neither Party will knowingly engage in, facilitate, or fail to remediate invalid activity, click fraud, spoofing, or other prohibited conduct. Interlincx’s payment obligations are contingent upon Interlincx’s actual receipt from System One; amounts disallowed by System One or Google shall not be payable.

5. Data, Tracking, and Reporting
The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to exchange operational data and reporting necessary for reconciliation (e.g., revenue statements, adjustments, timing of receipts, and distribution confirmations). Any shared data shall be used solely to perform under this Agreement and kept confidential per Section 8.

6. Term and Termination
6.1 Term. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues month-to-month unless terminated.

6.2 Termination. Either Party may terminate for convenience upon [7] days’ written notice. Either Party may terminate immediately for material breach not cured within [10] days after written notice.

6.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, Interlincx shall pay Naudilus any undisputed amounts then due and actually received from System One, subject to adjustments. Sections 3.3, 3.5, 5, 7–12 shall survive.

7. Representations and Warranties
Each Party represents and warrants that: (a) it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its formation; (b) it has the power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement; (c) its performance will comply with applicable laws; and (d) it will not knowingly introduce malware or engage in fraudulent or deceptive practices.

8. Confidentiality
Each Party ("Receiving Party") shall keep confidential and use only for performance under this Agreement all non-public information disclosed by the other Party ("Disclosing Party"). This obligation does not apply to information that is publicly available, already known without obligation, independently developed, or lawfully obtained from a third party. If required by law to disclose, the Receiving Party will provide prompt notice (where legally permitted).

9. Indemnification
Each Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party and its affiliates against third-party claims arising from the indemnifying Party’s (a) breach of this Agreement; (b) violation of law; or (c) gross negligence or willful misconduct. The indemnified Party shall provide prompt notice and reasonable cooperation; the indemnifying Party shall control the defense, subject to the indemnified Party’s right to participate with its own counsel at its own expense.

10. Limitation of Liability
Except for (i) a Party’s indemnification obligations, (ii) breach of confidentiality, or (iii) fraud or willful misconduct, neither Party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Except for the foregoing carve-outs, each Party’s aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the amounts paid or payable by Interlincx to Naudilus under this Agreement in the [three (3)] months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

11. Independent Contractors; No Agency
The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing herein creates a partnership, joint venture, franchise, fiduciary duty, or employment relationship. Neither Party may bind the other.

12. Audit and Records
Each Party will maintain reasonable books and records supporting amounts invoiced, paid, and distributed under this Agreement for at least [one (1)] year. Upon at least [10] business days’ notice and no more than once per year, the other Party (or its auditor) may review such records during normal business hours to verify compliance with payment terms; each Party will keep such information confidential.

15. Miscellaneous
