Naudilus LLC × Adnet LLC — Account Access and Media Arbitrage Agreement

Effective Date: [__________]

This Account Access and Media Arbitrage Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between Naudilus LLC ("Naudilus") and Adnet LLC ("Adnet"). Naudilus and Adnet are each a "Party" and, collectively, the "Parties."

1. Purpose and Scope
Adnet maintains a publisher/advertising account with Microsoft (MSN/Microsoft Advertising) (the "MSN Account"). The Parties desire to enable media buying for search arbitrage using the MSN Account, subject to Microsoft policies and applicable law. Naudilus will fund and direct buying for arbitrage and, as between the Parties, will receive payments from its upstream partner (Interlincx) and distribute funds to Adnet as set forth herein.

2. Roles and Responsibilities
2.1 Adnet (Account Provider)
- Provides access to the MSN Account for the limited purpose of supporting arbitrage media buying directed by Naudilus.
- Maintains ultimate administrative control over the MSN Account and may implement commercially reasonable safeguards, spend caps, and policy controls to protect the account’s standing.
- Cooperates in good faith on placement approvals, tracking, and compliance reviews.

2.2 Naudilus (Media Buyer / Funding Party)
- Directs media buying strategy, budgets, and campaigns within the MSN Account for arbitrage use cases, subject to Microsoft policies and Adnet’s account safety guidelines.
- Ensures creatives, landing pages, and tracking comply with applicable policies and law.
- Provides Adnet with necessary campaign information for review and reasonable reporting to reconcile spend and performance.

3. Money Flow; Payment Terms
3.1 Flow of Funds. Upstream revenue is collected and paid through the following chain: Google → System One → Interlincx → Naudilus. Naudilus will then distribute amounts to Adnet as set forth below.

3.2 Pay-As-Paid; Timing. Naudilus shall remit to Adnet on a pay-as-paid basis within [5] business days after Naudilus’s actual receipt of cleared funds from Interlincx for the relevant period. Naudilus has no obligation to advance or pay amounts not actually received.

3.3 Adjustments. All payments are subject to upstream adjustments (including but not limited to refunds, credits, chargebacks, clawbacks, invalid activity, policy deductions, or later-accruing offsets). Naudilus may net such adjustments against current or future amounts; where netting is not feasible, Adnet shall promptly refund or permit off-set of any overpaid amounts.

3.4 Costs/Fees. The Parties may agree in writing on account access fees, operations fees, or other costs (if any) payable to Adnet for providing and maintaining the MSN Account. Any such fees shall be set forth in an order form, statement of work, or addendum referencing this Agreement.

3.5 Taxes. Each Party is responsible for its own taxes arising from payments under this Agreement, except for taxes that Naudilus is required by law to withhold, which will be withheld and remitted as required. The Parties will cooperate to furnish appropriate tax documentation (e.g., W-9/W-8).

4. Account Use; Compliance; Safety
4.1 Policy Compliance. All campaigns, creatives, landing pages, tracking pixels, and data collection must comply with Microsoft Advertising policies and applicable laws (including privacy, marketing, and consumer protection laws). The Parties will cooperate to promptly address any policy concerns or enforcement actions.

4.2 Account Controls. Adnet may implement reasonable spend caps, brand-safety settings, or pause campaigns to protect the MSN Account’s standing, after notifying Naudilus where practicable. The Parties will coordinate to balance performance with account safety.

4.3 Prohibited Conduct. Neither Party shall engage in or knowingly permit invalid activity, click fraud, spoofing, or deceptive practices. Violations may lead to immediate suspension of account access and, if material, termination under Section 7.

5. Data, Tracking, and Reporting
The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to exchange operational data sufficient for reconciliation, including spend, campaign performance, upstream revenue statements communicated to Naudilus, and distribution confirmations. Shared data shall be used solely to perform under this Agreement and kept confidential per Section 8.

6. Intellectual Property
Except for the limited rights expressly granted to use the MSN Account for arbitrage, no licenses are granted. Each Party retains ownership of its respective trademarks, content, creatives, software, data, and other intellectual property.

7. Term and Termination
7.1 Term. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues month-to-month unless terminated.

7.2 Termination. Either Party may terminate for convenience upon [7] days’ written notice. Either Party may terminate immediately for material breach not cured within [10] days after written notice. Adnet may immediately suspend account access for suspected policy violations or to protect account standing, with prompt notice to Naudilus.

7.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, Naudilus shall pay Adnet any undisputed amounts then due and actually received from Interlincx, subject to adjustments. Sections 3.3, 3.5, 4, 5, 8–12 shall survive.

8. Confidentiality
Each Party ("Receiving Party") shall keep confidential and use only for performance under this Agreement all non-public information disclosed by the other Party ("Disclosing Party"). This obligation does not apply to information that is publicly available, already known without obligation, independently developed, or lawfully obtained from a third party. If required by law to disclose, the Receiving Party will provide prompt notice (where legally permitted).

9. Representations and Warranties
Each Party represents and warrants that: (a) it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its formation; (b) it has the power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement; (c) its performance will comply with applicable laws; and (d) it will not knowingly introduce malware or engage in fraudulent or deceptive practices.

10. Indemnification
Each Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party and its affiliates against third-party claims arising from the indemnifying Party’s (a) breach of this Agreement; (b) violation of law; or (c) gross negligence or willful misconduct, subject to prompt notice and cooperation. The indemnifying Party shall control the defense, subject to the indemnified Party’s right to participate with its own counsel at its own expense.

11. Limitation of Liability
Except for (i) a Party’s indemnification obligations, (ii) breach of confidentiality, or (iii) fraud or willful misconduct, neither Party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Except for the foregoing carve-outs, each Party’s aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the amounts paid or payable by Naudilus to Adnet under this Agreement in the [three (3)] months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

12. Independent Contractors; No Agency
The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing herein creates a partnership, joint venture, franchise, fiduciary duty, or employment relationship. Neither Party may bind the other. Adnet’s provision of account access does not make Adnet a reseller or agent of Naudilus.

15. Miscellaneous
This Agreement (including any incorporated order forms/SOWs) is the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings on the subject matter. Any amendments must be in writing and signed by both Parties. Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent, except to a successor in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets (with notice). If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. Waivers must be in writing.
