Interlincx Media Corp. × Adnet LLC — Service Level Agreement (Arbitrage Program)

Effective Date: [__________]

This Service Level Agreement (the "SLA") is entered into by and between Interlincx Media Corp. ("Interlincx") and Adnet LLC ("Adnet"). This SLA sets forth service levels, operating mechanisms, metrics, and review cadences for Adnet’s provision of media buying and product support services to Interlincx for the search arbitrage program. This SLA is intended to be efficient, fair, and based on clear, measurable operating mechanisms.

1. Purpose, Scope, and Relationship to Other Agreements
1.1 Purpose. Interlincx engages Adnet to provide media buying and related product support services for the arbitrage program, including the use of the Microsoft (MSN/Microsoft Advertising) publisher account maintained by Adnet, where appropriate and compliant.

1.2 Scope. This SLA governs service performance, operating cadence, and accountability mechanisms. Commercial payment flows (including pay-as-paid and upstream adjustments) are administered through Naudilus LLC as paying agent/intermediary under separate agreements (Interlincx–Naudilus and Naudilus–Adnet). This SLA does not modify commercial economics established elsewhere; it defines service quality and operating expectations between Interlincx and Adnet.

1.3 No Guarantee of Outcome. Targets herein are service levels and operating goals, not guarantees of profitability or specific financial outcomes.

2. Tenets and Owners
2.1 Tenets. The Parties agree to the following tenets:
- Customer obsession: prioritize compliance, account safety, and durable program health over short-term gains.
- Mechanisms over intent: define clear inputs/outputs, owners, and metrics; review results frequently; fix root causes.
- Prefer reversible changes by default: experiment within guardrails; escalate non-reversible decisions.
- Bias for action with safety: act fast while protecting platform/publisher standing.

2.2 Owners. Adnet shall designate an overall Service Owner responsible for this SLA. Interlincx shall designate a Business Owner for approvals, priorities, and escalation.

3. Named Personnel and Roles
3.1 Media Buyers (Adnet). The following personnel (employees/contractors) provide media buying services: Anastasia, Ben, Mike, TJ, and Brie (collectively, the "Media Buyers").

3.2 Product Support (Adnet). Lian provides product assistance, including landing page, tracking, and integration coordination ("Product Support").

3.3 Continuity. Adnet may replace or add personnel with reasonably comparable qualifications upon [5] business days’ notice to Interlincx. Interlincx’s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

4. Service Levels (SLOs)
4.1 Availability & Coverage.
- Business-hours coverage: Monday–Friday, 8:00–18:00 PT ("Business Hours").
- On-call for Sev1 incidents: [Yes/No]. If Yes: acknowledgment within 30 minutes, mitigation begins within 2 hours, 24×7.

4.2 Turnaround Times (during Business Hours).
- New campaign build and launch after approved spec: ≤ 2 business days.
- Creative/landing page iteration (no net-new integration): ≤ 1 business day.
- Bid/budget changes, urgent: ≤ 2 hours.
- Tracking/pixel repair (no new vendor onboarding): ≤ 1 business day.

4.3 Incident Response (Severities).
- Sev1 (critical impact: policy enforcement, major invalid activity spike, platform account risk, or >30% revenue at risk): ack ≤ 30 minutes; mitigation start ≤ 2 hours; executive update cadence ≤ 2 hours until mitigated.
- Sev2 (material impact: KPI deviation >10% for a key segment, non-critical tracking failure): ack ≤ 4 hours; mitigation plan ≤ 1 business day.
- Sev3 (minor impact: reporting mismatch, non-urgent optimization): ack ≤ 1 business day; mitigation ≤ 3 business days.

4.4 Compliance & Quality.
- Policy compliance: zero-tolerance for knowingly serving disallowed content or tactics; immediate pause and notify upon detection; RCAs per 5.3.
- Invalid activity guardrail: maintain invalid/spam/IVT rate within upstream platform tolerance. Breaches trigger immediate mitigation and RCA.
- Account safety: Adnet may enforce reasonable controls (spend caps, brand-safety settings, pauses) to protect account standing with prompt notice to Interlincx.

4.5 Reporting & Reviews.
- Daily report (by 10:00 PT): spend, revenue, margin, CPC/CPA, top queries, policy/IVT flags, planned actions.
- Monthly/Quarterly Planning: roadmap, mechanisms improvements, resourcing, and risk review.

5. Mechanisms (Inputs/Outputs)
5.1 Standard Inputs (from Interlincx).
- Approved business goals/guardrails for the period (margin targets, spend ceilings, partner constraints).
- Creative/product approvals and legal/policy guidance.
- Access to required data sources and upstream reporting as available.

5.2 Standard Outputs (from Adnet).
- Daily performance reports; change logs for major optimizations.
- Experiment proposal briefs for significant changes (non-reversible decisions escalate for pre-approval).
- Compliance attestations for creatives/flows in use.

5.3 Root-Cause Analysis (RCA) Mechanism.
- For Sev1/Sev2 incidents or repeated SLO misses: written RCA within 2 business days post-mitigation, including problem statement, contributing causes, verified fix, prevention mechanism, and owner/date.

6. Data, Access, and Security
6.1 Access Control. Adnet retains administrative control of the MSN Account. Interlincx and Adnet will use least-privilege access and disable unused accounts. Personnel changes: remove/adjust access within 24 hours.

6.2 Data Use. Each Party will use shared data solely to perform under this SLA and keep such data confidential under Section 10.

6.3 Tooling. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to instrument attribution, pixels, and dashboards consistent with platform policies.

7. Service Credits (If Applicable)
7.1 Credits. If Adnet materially fails to meet any SLO in Section 4 (excluding force majeure, upstream failures, or instances where Interlincx has not provided required Inputs), Adnet will provide a service credit equal to 5% of monthly service fees (if any) for each distinct breached SLO in the month, capped at 20% of such fees.

7.2 Application. Where the commercial model does not include a separate service fee, the Parties agree to apply credits as a reduction to amounts otherwise payable to Adnet for the period (administered via Naudilus), with any excess credits carried to the following month.

8. Change Management
8.1 Reversible vs Non-Reversible Changes. Routine optimizations are reversible changes and may proceed within guardrails. Material changes with durable risk (account structure overhauls, policy-sensitive flows) are non-reversible and require Interlincx pre-approval via a brief proposal and risk assessment.

8.2 Freeze Windows. Adnet will coordinate change freezes during critical upstream windows as requested by Interlincx or platforms.

9. Payments and Relationship to Naudilus
9.1 Pay-As-Paid. Interlincx’s payment obligations to Adnet for services under the arbitrage program are satisfied through Naudilus acting as intermediary/paying agent. Payments to Adnet are on a pay-as-paid basis following Interlincx’s actual receipt from its upstream partner(s), subject to adjustments.

9.2 Adjustments. All amounts are subject to upstream adjustments (refunds, credits, clawbacks, invalid activity, policy deductions). Credits under Section 7 will be applied via Naudilus netting where feasible.

10. Confidentiality
Each Party shall keep confidential and use only for performance under this SLA all non-public information of the other Party, with standard exceptions for information that is public, previously known without obligation, independently developed, or rightfully obtained from a third party. Legal disclosures require prompt notice where permitted.

11. Intellectual Property
Each Party retains ownership of its intellectual property. Except for the limited right to use the MSN Account for the program, no licenses are granted.

12. Representations, Indemnification, and Liability
12.1 Representations. Each Party represents it is duly organized and authorized and will comply with applicable laws and platform policies.

12.2 Indemnification. Each Party will indemnify and defend the other from third-party claims arising from its breach of this SLA, violation of law, or gross negligence/willful misconduct, subject to prompt notice and reasonable cooperation. The indemnifying Party controls the defense; the other may participate at its own expense.

12.3 Limitation of Liability. Except for (i) indemnification obligations, (ii) confidentiality breaches, or (iii) fraud/willful misconduct, neither Party is liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Except for those carve-outs, each Party’s aggregate liability under this SLA is limited to the amounts paid or payable to Adnet for the program in the three (3) months preceding the event giving rise to liability.

13. Term, Termination, and Suspension
13.1 Term. This SLA starts on the Effective Date and continues month-to-month unless terminated.

13.2 Termination. Either Party may terminate for convenience on [7] days’ written notice. Either Party may terminate immediately for material breach not cured within [10] days after written notice.

13.3 Suspension. Adnet may temporarily suspend campaigns or access to protect account standing or address policy enforcement, with prompt notice to Interlincx.

13.4 Survival. Sections 6–12 and 15–17 survive termination.

14. Independent Contractors; No Agency
The Parties are independent contractors; no partnership, joint venture, franchise, fiduciary, or employment relationship is created. Neither Party may bind the other.

17. Order of Precedence; Entire Agreement
