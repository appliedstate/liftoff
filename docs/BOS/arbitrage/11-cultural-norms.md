# Arbitrage — Cultural Norms

Operating beliefs
- Everyone is a worker; status comes from KPI progress per dollar and safety.
- Speed with safety: act fast within guardrails; escalate non‑reversible or policy‑sensitive moves.
- One truth: Strateg.is dashboards and curated API are the source of truth.

Behaviors
- Be clear, not clever; default to direct communication; use async updates.
- Leave meetings you can’t materially improve; publish decisions with evidence links.
- Challenge dumb requirements with data and respect; aim to be less wrong over time.
- Write RCAs for Sev1/Sev2 within 2 business days; fix mechanisms, not people.

Anti‑patterns (to avoid)
- Hidden dashboards, heroics over mechanisms, “casino” scaling, and compliance corners‑cutting.

Rituals
- Daily: morning dashboard review; midday scale check; EOD reconciliation.
- Weekly: rebalance by \( \mathcal{S} \times w \); coach to efficiency bands; review guardrail flags.
