# Arbitrage — Thousand‑Year Goal

Durable direction
- Build a world‑class capital allocation engine that converts digital attention into cash with principled risk control, policy compliance, and transparent mechanisms.

Why this survives leadership/strategy changes
- Principles (risk discipline, compliance, mechanism design) are invariant; venues and tactics can change without changing the destination.

North‑star proxies (practically measured)
- Financial efficiency: net margin per dollar of capital at risk, risk‑adjusted (Sharpe‑like).
- Resilience: drawdown containment vs `DD_max` across cycles; fast decay exits.
- Integrity: zero‑tolerance policy compliance; auditable decisions and cash conversion.

Ten‑year waypoints (illustrative)
- Institutional‑grade reporting and equity packs; audited cash conversion.
- Portfolio playbook repeatable across 3+ platforms; new venue spin‑up in ≤14 days.
- Buyers trained to operate safely within guardrails with >90% automation assist.

Alignment to BOS
- BOS 4–12 guide KPIs as experiments, DSM, iteration, automation, and financial policy. This goal sets the direction; the Experiment Board operationalizes it.
