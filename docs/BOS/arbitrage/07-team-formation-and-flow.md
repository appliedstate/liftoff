# Arbitrage — Team Formation and Flow

Team topology
- Trading cells centered on KPI rows (Experiment Board): buyer + analyst + automation assist.
- Cross‑functional help (creative, landing, tracking) joins cells as needed for specific experiments.

Roles
- Buyer (DRI): launch/operate campaigns within guardrails; owns kill/keep/scale decisions.
- Analyst: variance/CI, decay, receipts forecast; flags risk and cash cushion.
- Automation: terminal rules, data pulls, dashboards, alerting.
- Creative/LP support: supply validated assets and fixes.

Switching norms
- Individuals can switch cells freely to maximize company‑level value; announce in weekly review.
- Owners reassign budgets when efficiency bands breached or priority changes.

Rituals
- Daily: morning dashboard review; midday step‑up check; EOD reconciliation.
- Weekly: rebalance by \( \mathcal{S} \times w \); set launch quotas; coach buyers to efficiency targets.

Interfaces to DSM & Experiment Board
- Each cell maintains evidence links on the Experiment Board row.
- Alerts route to the DRI; major actions carry correlation IDs and summary notes.

Escalation
- Policy/compliance, account safety, or non‑reversible changes escalate to owners.
