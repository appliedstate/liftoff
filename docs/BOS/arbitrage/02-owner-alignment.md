# Arbitrage — Owner Alignment

Owners: Eric Roach (ER), Narbeh Ghazalian (NG)

Durable destination
- Build a disciplined, compliant arbitrage portfolio that compounds working capital into cash with strict risk controls and repeatable mechanisms. Target: $10k/day net margin with healthy drawdown limits and cash cushion.

Invariants (do not change without explicit owner agreement)
- Policy/compliance and account safety supersede short‑term gains.
- Variable comp ≤35% of net; buyer ≤20%; accruals release on cash collection.
- Portfolio risk: stop‑out at −DD_max; per‑buyer risk ≤15% (new ≤8%); diversification ≤35% per platform bucket.
- 70/30 cash model is the base; payouts align to realized receipts.

Decision rights
- Capital allocation (budgets across platforms/buckets): joint owner decision weekly; buyers act within assigned caps daily.
- Partner onboarding/termination, policy‑sensitive flows, account structure overhauls: owner pre‑approval required.
- Guardrail thresholds (DD_max, efficiency bands, payout caps): owners set; Ops enforces.

Operating cadence
- Daily: 07:00 dashboards; Sev1/Sev2 updates as needed; end‑of‑day reconciliation vs receipts schedule.
- Weekly: rebalance sheet; owner review of top/bottom buckets, risk utilization, comp accruals, and cash cushion.
- Monthly: equity pack review and approvals; revise scale plan to $10k/day.

Disagreements: tie‑break mechanism
- If EJR and NG disagree and a decision is reversible within guardrails, run a bounded experiment for ≤7 days and select by financial efficiency (KPI per $).
- If non‑reversible or policy‑sensitive, escalate to explicit written decision by both; default is no‑change.
