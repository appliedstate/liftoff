# Arbitrage — Rules (Sign‑to‑Work)

Authority bounds
- Launches within assigned budgets and platform policy are autonomous.
- Scale +15–25%/day while \( dM/dS > 0 \) and \( CI(M) > 0 \).
- Kill on 3‑day negative margin with 95% CI below 0.
- Immediate pause on safety/compliance risk; notify within the hour.

Approval gates (non‑reversible/policy‑sensitive)
- Partner onboarding/termination; account structure overhauls.
- Large capital increases; policy‑sensitive flows.

Risk & finance guardrails
- Portfolio stop‑out at −`DD_max`.
- Diversification: ≤35% per platform bucket; per‑buyer ≤15% daily risk (new ≤8%).
- Variable comp ≤35% of net; buyer ≤20%; accrues and releases on cash collection.
- Maintain cash cushion ≥ policy threshold vs \( K \) or auto‑throttle.

Data truth & evidence
- Strateg.is and curated API are the single source of truth.
- Attach evidence links to non‑trivial actions (dashboards, diagnostics, creatives/landers).

Communication SLAs
- Daily update by 10:00 local with spend, revenue, margin, flags, and plan.
- Sev1: ack ≤30m; mitigation ≤2h; updates ≤2h.

Sign‑to‑Work Acknowledgement
- I agree to operate within these rules and guardrails. Name/Date: ________________________
