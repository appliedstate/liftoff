# Liftoff — Cultural Norms

Operating beliefs
- Engineering excellence serves business outcomes; simplicity beats cleverness.
- Observability over opinions; shared metrics are the contract.
- Secure by default; least privilege; automation reduces toil.

Behaviors
- Ship small daily; write change notes; attach dashboards; own rollbacks.
- Treat SLOs as hard constraints; stop‑the‑line on red; RCA in 2 business days.
- Challenge requirements with data; delete before optimizing; keep interfaces clean.

Anti‑patterns (to avoid)
- Big‑bang releases; “it works on my machine”; silent failures; creeping scope without KPI impact.

Rituals
- Daily: monitor SLOs and error budgets; fix first, then feature.
- Weekly: review DORA, freshness, adoption; pick the next toil‑reduction targets.
