# Liftoff — Thousand‑Year Goal

Durable direction
- Build an enduring capability platform where data, automation, and product surfaces continuously reduce cycle time, raise quality, and lower unit cost for all businesses we run.

Why this survives leadership/strategy changes
- Investing in shared infrastructure (APIs, telemetry, automation) compounds regardless of specific markets or products.

North‑star proxies (practically measured)
- Cycle time: time from idea → shipped change; DORA metrics.
- Reliability: freshness SLA adherence; error budgets respected; fast MTTR.
- Adoption: % of ops workflows executed via platform APIs/tools; agent queries served via MCP → API.

Ten‑year waypoints (illustrative)
- Single versioned reporting API powering all human apps and AI agents.
- CI/CD with canaries for data and functions; incident learning loops institutionalized.
- Automation portfolio that removes 50%+ manual toil from arbitrage and future lines.

Alignment to BOS
- BOS 6–14 specify DSM, iteration, automation, financial policy, and onboarding. This goal sets the direction; the Experiment Board operationalizes it.
