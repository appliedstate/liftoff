> # Strategis Campaign Setup & Naming Convention Integration — Exploration Guide
> 
> ## Document Purpose
> This document outlines the exploration needed with Devin (Strategis agent) to understand how to:
> 1. Set up campaigns programmatically in Strategis
> 2. Have the Attention Engine control naming conventions for both Facebook campaigns AND Strategis tracking
> 3. Eliminate the manual dual-setup process (currently: set up in Strategis → then set up in Liftoff)
> 
> **Status**: Exploration Phase — Questions for Devin  
> **Owner**: Engineering (Platform) · Collaborators: Growth, Attention Factory  
> **Version**: 0.1 (2025-01-XX)
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Current State & Problem
> 
> ### Current Workflow (Manual, Duplicated)
> 1. **Team sets up campaign in Strategis**:
>    - Create campaign/tracking structure in Strategis
>    - Set up naming conventions manually
>    - Configure tracking parameters
> 
> 2. **Team sets up campaign in Liftoff**:
>    - Create campaign structure via Meta Ads API
>    - Apply naming conventions (from Attention Engine)
>    - Configure budgets, targeting, creatives
> 
> **Problem**: 
> - Dual manual setup is error-prone and time-consuming
> - Naming conventions may diverge between Strategis and Facebook
> - Attention Engine generates naming but can't apply it to Strategis
> - No single source of truth for campaign structure
> 
> ### Desired State (Automated, Unified)
> 1. **Attention Engine generates campaign plan**:
>    - Campaign structure (campaigns, ad sets, ads)
>    - Naming conventions (applied to both platforms)
>    - Targeting, budgets, creatives
> 
> 2. **Single API call creates in both systems**:
>    - Strategis: Campaign/tracking structure with naming
>    - Facebook: Campaign structure via Meta Ads API with naming
>    - Both use identical naming conventions from Attention Engine
> 
> ---
> 
> ## System Overview
> 
> ### Components
> - **Attention Engine (Liftoff)**: Generates hooks, creatives, media plans, and naming conventions
> - **Strategis**: Platform for campaign tracking, performance analysis, and automation
> - **Strategis Ad Manager**: Proposed service to create Facebook campaigns (see `docs/prd/strategis-facebook-ad-manager-prd.md`)
> - **Meta Ads API**: External API for Facebook campaign creation
> 
> ### Current Architecture
> ```
> Attention Engine (Liftoff)
>     ↓ (generates campaign plan + naming)
>     ├─→ Manual Setup in Strategis ❌
>     └─→ Manual Setup in Facebook ❌
> ```
> 
> ### Desired Architecture
> ```
> Attention Engine (Liftoff)
>     ↓ (generates campaign plan + naming)
>     ├─→ Strategis API (campaign setup + naming) ✅
>     └─→ Meta Ads API (campaign setup + naming) ✅
> ```

> ## Key Questions for Devin (Strategis Agent)
> 
> ### 🔴 CRITICAL: Campaign Creation in Strategis
> 
> #### Q1: Strategis Campaign Creation API
> **Question**: Does Strategis expose APIs to programmatically create campaigns and tracking structures?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] API endpoint(s) for campaign creation
> - [ ] API endpoint(s) for ad set/tracking setup
> - [ ] Request/response schemas
> - [ ] Authentication method
> - [ ] Idempotency support
> 
> **Context**: We need to create campaigns in Strategis with the same naming conventions that Attention Engine generates for Facebook.
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Q2: Naming Convention Application
> **Question**: How does Strategis handle campaign/tracking naming? Can we set names programmatically?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] How to set campaign names in Strategis
> - [ ] How to set ad set/tracking names
> - [ ] Naming format requirements (delimiters, length limits, special characters)
> - [ ] Whether Strategis has its own naming conventions we need to follow
> 
> **Context**: Attention Engine generates names like:
> - Campaign: `{Brand} | {Objective} | {HookSet} | {Market} | FB | {YYYY-MM-DD}`
> - Ad Set: `{AudienceKey} | {PlacementKey} | {OptimizationEvent} | {BudgetType} | v{N}`
> - Ad: `{CreativeType} | {HookId} | {Variant} | {Format} | {Lang}`
> 
> We need to apply these same names to Strategis tracking structures.
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Q3: Campaign Structure Mapping
> **Question**: How does Strategis structure campaigns? Does it mirror Facebook's hierarchy (Campaign → Ad Set → Ad)?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] Strategis object model (campaigns, ad sets, ads, tracking groups?)
> - [ ] How Strategis structures map to Facebook structures
> - [ ] Whether we can create a full hierarchy in one API call
> - [ ] Whether Strategis requires additional metadata beyond Facebook
> 
> **Context**: We need to create matching structures in both systems with consistent naming.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🟡 HIGH: Integration Points
> 
> #### Q4: Strategis Ad Manager Service
> **Question**: Is there a Strategis "Ad Manager" service (as proposed in `docs/prd/strategis-facebook-ad-manager-prd.md`) that can create Facebook campaigns? Or should we call Meta Ads API directly from Liftoff?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] Does Strategis Ad Manager exist?
> - [ ] If yes, API endpoints and schemas
> - [ ] If no, should we build it or call Meta Ads API directly?
> - [ ] How does it relate to Terminal (execution engine)?
> 
> **Context**: The PRD proposes Strategis Ad Manager as the service that creates Facebook campaigns. We need to know if this exists or needs to be built.
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Q5: Single Source of Truth
> **Question**: Should Strategis be the single source of truth for campaign structure, or should Liftoff coordinate both systems?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] Recommended architecture (Strategis-first vs Liftoff-first)
> - [ ] How to handle failures (if Strategis succeeds but Facebook fails, or vice versa)
> - [ ] State synchronization requirements
> - [ ] Rollback strategy
> 
> **Context**: We need to ensure consistency between Strategis and Facebook campaigns.
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Q6: Tracking Setup
> **Question**: What tracking setup is required in Strategis when creating campaigns?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] Required tracking parameters (pixel IDs, conversion events, UTM parameters?)
> - [ ] How to configure tracking for campaigns/ad sets
> - [ ] Whether tracking setup is separate from campaign creation
> - [ ] How tracking relates to Facebook pixel/events
> 
> **Context**: Currently team manually sets up tracking in Strategis. We need to automate this.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🟢 MEDIUM: Naming Convention Details
> 
> #### Q7: Naming Convention Validation
> **Question**: Does Strategis validate naming conventions? Are there constraints we need to follow?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] Maximum name length
> - [ ] Allowed/forbidden characters
> - [ ] Required format patterns
> - [ ] Whether Strategis enforces naming conventions
> 
> **Context**: We want to ensure Attention Engine naming works in both systems.
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Q8: Naming Synchronization
> **Question**: If a campaign name changes in Facebook, should it sync to Strategis (and vice versa)?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] Whether Strategis supports name updates
> - [ ] Whether we should sync name changes bidirectionally
> - [ ] How to handle name conflicts
> 
> **Context**: Names may change after creation (e.g., version bumps, corrections).
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Proposed Integration Flow
> 
> ### Option A: Strategis-First (If Strategis Ad Manager Exists)
> ```
> Attention Engine (Liftoff)
>     ↓ (generates campaign plan + naming)
>     ↓
> Strategis Ad Manager API
>     ├─→ Create in Strategis (campaign + tracking + naming)
>     └─→ Create in Facebook (campaign + ad sets + ads + naming)
>     ↓
> Return IDs from both systems
> ```
> 
> **Pros**:
> - Single API call
> - Strategis coordinates both systems
> - Ensures consistency
> 
> **Cons**:
> - Requires Strategis Ad Manager to exist
> - More complex error handling
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Option B: Liftoff-Coordinated (If No Strategis Ad Manager)
> ```
> Attention Engine (Liftoff)
>     ↓ (generates campaign plan + naming)
>     ↓
> Liftoff Campaign Factory
>     ├─→ Strategis API (create campaign + tracking + naming)
>     └─→ Meta Ads API (create campaign + ad sets + ads + naming)
>     ↓
> Store mappings (Strategis ID ↔ Facebook ID)
> ```
> 
> **Pros**:
> - Works with existing Strategis APIs
> - Liftoff controls the flow
> - Can handle partial failures
> 
> **Cons**:
> - Two API calls to coordinate
> - Need to handle consistency
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Option C: Parallel Creation (Simplest)
> ```
> Attention Engine (Liftoff)
>     ↓ (generates campaign plan + naming)
>     ↓
> Parallel API Calls
>     ├─→ Strategis API (create campaign + naming)
>     └─→ Meta Ads API (create campaign + naming)
>     ↓
> Store mappings
> ```
> 
> **Pros**:
> - Simple to implement
> - Independent systems
> 
> **Cons**:
> - No coordination
> - Risk of inconsistency
> - Need to handle failures separately
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Naming Convention Flow
> 
> ### Current Naming Convention (from `docs/marketing/buyer-guide-naming-and-campaign-templates.md`)
> 
> **Campaign Name**:
> ```
> {Brand} | {Objective} | {HookSet} | {Market} | {Channel} | {YYYY-MM-DD}
> Example: BrandX | CONVERSIONS | hookset_juvederm_2025_10_21 | US | FB | 2025-10-22
> ```
> 
> **Ad Set Name**:
> ```
> {AudienceKey} | {PlacementKey} | {OptimizationEvent} | {BudgetType=CBO|ABO} | v{N}
> Example: ll_2p_purchasers_180 | advplus_all_auto | PURCHASE | CBO | v1
> ```
> 
> **Ad Name**:
> ```
> {CreativeType=IMG|VID} | {HookId} | {Variant} | {Format=1x1|4x5|9x16} | {Lang}
> Example: VID | H123 | A | 4x5 | EN
> ```
> 
> ### How Attention Engine Generates Names
> 
> **Inputs**:
> - Brand (from campaign plan)
> - Objective (CONVERSIONS, LEAD_GENERATION, etc.)
> - HookSet ID (e.g., `hookset_juvederm_2025_10_21`)
> - Market (US, CA, etc.)
> - Channel (FB, IG, etc.)
> - Date (campaign launch date)
> - Audience keys (from targeting plan)
> - Placement keys (from placement plan)
> - Creative metadata (type, hook ID, variant, format, language)
> 
> **Output**: Fully formatted names for campaigns, ad sets, and ads
> 
> ### Application to Strategis
> 
> **Question**: How do these names map to Strategis structures?
> 
> **What We Need**:
> - [ ] Does Strategis use the same naming format?
> - [ ] Does Strategis have additional naming requirements?
> - [ ] How to map Facebook campaign/ad set/ad names to Strategis equivalents?
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Implementation Requirements
> 
> ### From Strategis Side
> 
> 1. **Campaign Creation API**:
>    - Endpoint to create campaigns with naming
>    - Endpoint to create ad sets/tracking groups with naming
>    - Support for Attention Engine naming format
> 
> 2. **Naming Convention Support**:
>    - Accept names in Attention Engine format
